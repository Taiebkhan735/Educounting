					A recent survey conducted by a trusted financial institution found
					that many Americans share concerns that keep them from donating to
					charity as much as they would like. In fact, the survey determined
					that as many as two-thirds of American donors would like to be more
					charitable when it comes to the causes that they care most about.
					Still, they have several concerns about charitable giving, making it
					challenging to give as much as they would like.<br />
					<br />
					Some of the concerns that seem to get in the way of charitable giving
					for some Americans include how nonprofit organizations engage with
					them and an inability to organize or track their charitable giving
					properly. However, the survey found two key primary concerns among
					American donors. First, donors said that the ability to finance their
					charitable giving was a chief concern. Second, donors said that
					understanding their donations’ impact was also a major concern. <br />
					<br />
					If this resonates with you and you are one of the three-quarters of
					American donors who said that the ability to finance their charitable
					giving was a major concern or one of the eight in ten people who say
					that understanding the impact of their donations was a concern, read
					on. This article will outline seven ways, based on these common
					concerns, that can help you improve your charitable giving, no matter
					what charity you choose to support or how much you’re comfortable
					contributing.
				</p>

					Half of the survey respondents noted that they would be apt to
					contribute more to their charity of choice if additional tax benefits
					were added. Unfortunately, many charitable donors are not taking
					advantage of all available tax deductions.<br />
					<br />
					One great way to contribute to charities while leaving your cash in
					place is by donating appreciated assets, such as stocks, directly to
					the charity of your choice. When you do so, you might be able to avoid
					capital gains tax on the stock appreciation. So, you can increase your
					charitable donation while decreasing tax exposure.<br />

					An essential component of charitable giving is understanding what you
					can afford. That can be a challenge. Four in ten donors say they were
					conflicted over whether to save their money for themselves or donate
					their money to charity.<br />
					<br />
					A financial advisor or financial planner can help identify and develop
					a plan to reach your charitable goals as part of your overall
					financial plan. Financial advisors can also help identify tax-saving
					plans that you may not be aware of. Nearly 53 percent of survey
					respondents said they felt bombarded by charity requests, further
					complicating their decisions around donating to charity. The survey
					also found that 45 percent of Americans felt burdened by family and
					friends who pressured them into donating to charitable organizations
					that were personal to them.<br />
					<br />
					When you create a mission statement for giving, you’ll be better able
					to focus on the issues that matter most to you. A giving mission
					statement is a great way to permit yourself to say “no” to other
					charitable causes that might be worthy but do not necessarily align
					with your priorities or values.
